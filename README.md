# Collection Management System

This project allows users to keep track of their collectible items by forming collections. Users may edit their collections and view the total valuation of their collections across all items. They may also view auctions that contain their items and view the previous owners of their items.

To run the project:
1. Input your Oracle credentials in .env
2. Run ./remote-start.sh
